- Who wants to help me pick tonight’s lingerie? 👀
- My DMs are getting wild lately…

3. Polls and Spicy Opinions

- Big chest or big heart?
- Lace or leather tonight?

4. "Good morning/good night" With a Twist

- Good night babes… or should I say bad night? 😏

5. Confessions & Secrets

- POV: You walk in and see me in your shirt.

7. Engagement Starters

- Use 3 emojis to describe me.

8. Dares & Games Examples
